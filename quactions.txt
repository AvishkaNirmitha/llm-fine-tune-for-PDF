Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): we are also seeing a number of accounts with Leverage Mismatch issue. I raised this issue a few weeks ago and you were unable to find a problem, 
but we are seeing it on a number of accounts. nichole@swaffer.com.au OVERFLOW 3 x Trades - HBAR & XRP showing as Cross Leverage, BNB showing as ISO. I’ve been in the account trying to get it to re-enable tracking, I’ve tried changing settings to cross but it continues to show Bybit Platfork Error “Server Error” continually. Why we are seeing trades in ISO strategy being opened in Bybit in Cross Leverage? Can you please investigate this one and advise the path forward ASAP please.

with leverage settings, order sizes, and trade tracking.

Regarding your question about Leverage Mismatch, I'll do my best to help you investigate this issue. From what you've described, it appears that some accounts are showing trades in ISO strategy being opened in Bybit in Cross Leverage, which is causing the "Server Error" message.

To better understand the issue, can you please provide more details about the specific accounts experiencing this problem? For example:

1. What are the exact error messages they're seeing?
2. Are there any common factors among these accounts (e.g., same trading strategy, similar market conditions)?
3. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps or adjustments to resolve the issue?

Once I have more information, I can assist in investigating this further and providing guidance on the path forward.

 what is close

Response: Based on the provided context, "Close" has multiple meanings depending on the context.

In one instance, it refers to a candle indicator where "red)" means the close was lower than the open. In another instance, it's an action in the Karbon platform where users can define a profit or loss percentage and position size that need to trigger the closure of a trade.

Additionally, there is a mention of "Close My Trade" which seems to be related to closing a trade based on profits or losses.

Let me know if you have any further questions!
